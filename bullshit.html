<p><strong><em>Credentials:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>üíº Freshman at Rmit University</p>
<p>üéì Graduated Binh Phu High school 2019, Ielts Academic 6.5</p>
<p>üìå Lives in HCM city.</p>
<p>üñå Music composer, drama scenes improvisor</p>
<p><strong><em>About me:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone, I am Huy, a student who has been studying about one year in Rmit. I am Vietnamese, I am 19 years old live in HCM city. When I was in High School, groups of people introduced Rmit to everyone. I was not so interested in Rmit but found that my personal passion is the key to learn there. I was really successful in my High School, I was still terrible in those days. However, the light had come when I was in summer grade 11, I found and tried to download the game &ldquo;Plants vs Zombies&rdquo; because I wanted to taste the feeling I had when I was young. Something was different, I wanted to investigate everything in the game and therefore I wanted to become a game designer later on!</p>
<p><strong><em>Facts:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I really lack of confident yet have many potentials.</li>
<li>I can make music which fit my feeling.</li>
</ul>
<p>-Behind the ùÑΩ, ùÑæ, ùÑø, I wish AD could be music just to make me enjoy everyday.</p>
<p><strong>Interest in IT</strong></p>
<p>- I am fascinated in developing apps, games which are quite important in IT. Of all branches in IT, I choose to develop games since I truly have a story why I would become a game designer. Moreover, I am interested in explaining the details of some famous apps just like Tantacrul did. Like this one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKx1wnXClcI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKx1wnXClcI</a></p>
<p>-My interest began during grade 11 summer . The vital thing to know is game designing is the core of why I chose IT. It must be admitted, however, that the passion I have is large and the passion grows by chance. I was truly proud of the time I rescued myself to have a better learning in High School because it was the passion I carried that motivated me to pursue my aspiration.</p>
<p>- I convinced myself to find a crack version of &ldquo;Plants vs Zombies&rdquo; to taste the feeling I used to have. As mentioned earlier, I did not have any feeling which I used to have but the passion of character acting. The interest in trying something new and making everyone to make memes of or laugh motivated me to think of a scene which relates to that game which I could act. As the time went by, things were inclined to change, the only unique thing that I gained is zombie acting which is separate from all other genres in the world and nobody could have the same scenario.</p>
<p>- In the first place, the Rmit groups came and introduced students in my High School. Since the school focuses more on Technology so I applied and learned there. Secondly, the material like resources, help center in Rmit varied although they are not helpful for my situations.</p>
<p>- I am looking forward to learn about game making, coding. I want to be known that I would come from an app development background to game making. Furthermore, I want to learn about mathematics for computing. I want to experience learning in foreigner style because I get used to learning in Vietnamese environment.</p>
<p><strong>Ideal Job</strong></p>
<p>I have found this advertisement from EA company recently. Frankly speaking, the game designer position within this website really caught my interest. The detailed advertisement here shows everthing I need to understand, descriptions within this site seem to be trustworthy. I would like to mention that, various social media such as Facebook mentions EA a lot. One who mentions tend to be a gamer theirself so I fairly understand this website&rsquo;s customers behaviour and I gain benefit from that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the link.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Descriptions</em></strong></p>
<p>This position combines skills and understanding of game making. Also I have to be a very creative storyteller to boost game experience. This job is suitable for me since I really love many processes which this job requests. I aspire to make games in order to include my uniqueness, productivity in that. Since I really want to be a part of this community, it is essential for me to compare skills, qualifications, experience required and those I currently have with the objective to be well-rounded with these demands.</p>
<p>This site itself contains those aspects. In short, when it comes to skills, I will have to report to Frostbite's Creative Director. Also, help their development process extra vigorous. When it comes to qualifications, it goes without saying that I must provide a range of games using my own ideas, be able to work in a team to improve game content, also obtain new features, can deal with documentation, and build tech demos. Finally, they need me to be experienced in Unity, have some understanding of game design, and the fundamentals of game design.</p>
<p>Having a deep insight in myself, I acknowledged that I don&rsquo;t have any skills that could possibly fit with the requirement. Despite my lack of skills, I have innated qualifications which have something to do with game making. To be specific, I can use my own ideas, can confront dead-end scenarios such as run out of ideas, can brainstorm because it is my favorite thing to do. Whilst learning in RMIT, Rmit itself has already equipped me with the basic knowledge of Python, Programming, concept of IT. Not to mention that I can use a little bit of Game Maker 8 program to create my first game when I was in grade 7 and I have learnt some basic concept of game making using Rmit Library resources.</p>
<p>To conclude, with the regulations I am carrying right now. I would say that they are no match with the standards that the company gave out. What can be expected here are time, determination, and I need to enhance my resolve. I don&rsquo;t need to be perfect but the road to EA&rsquo;s regulations may be challenging. To achieve this road I would keep developing my standards that I have right now. If you do what you are familiar with and put your heart in it, you will always learn something. To be specific, I will boost my brainstorming skills, make more games using game maker 8, learn more game making concepts. Finally, Under no circumstances should I graduate Rmit with flying colors. This is the crucial step that I must pass so that I can apply for a job in EA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Must-have Regulations in EA are in this screenshot, also the rest of the advertisment.</em></p>

<p><strong>Personal Profile</strong></p>
<p>Many companies should want more evidence to check whether or not I have enough standards to be applied. What can be expected here are the three online tests which I decided to complete. The online tests are the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test, learning style test and &ldquo;Are you an introvert or an extrovert?&rdquo; test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/type-finder-personality-test-new">https://www.truity.com/test/type-finder-personality-test-new</a></p>

<p><em><br /><br /></em></p>
<p>INTP - The Architect</p>
<p>VERY GOOD MATCH</p>
<p>INTPs are philosophical innovators, fascinated by logical analysis, systems, and design. They are preoccupied with theory, and search for the universal law behind everything they see.</p>
<p><em><br /></em>INTJ - The Mastermind</p>
<p>GOOD MATCH</p>
<p>INTJs are analytical problem-solvers, eager to improve systems and processes with their innovative ideas. They have a talent for seeing possibilities for improvement, whether at work, at home, or in themselves.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Are you an introvert or an extrovert?&rdquo; test result.</strong></p>
<p><em>You are more of a public introvert and private extrovert</em></p>
<p>Within your circle of family and friends, you are completely at ease and it&rsquo;s often you who takes the lead to organise outings, dinners, vacations, etc. However, as soon as you are in a public or professional setting you become rather inhibited. You don&rsquo;t feel in tune with what you would qualify as agitation, rivalry or vainglory and this can sometimes appear to others as a kind of hidden criticism or a lack of ambition. In fact, your pragmatic temperament helps you successfully manage problems as and when they arise. You aren&rsquo;t the kind to calculate your every move and plan every inch of your life, and you find the sphere of family and friends to be much more gratifying to the professional sphere. You are more expressive in emotional, sensorial and human terms and at home your organisation skills and capacity to oil the family wheels work well and many of your family and friends appreciate your qualities and skills. At first glance, people find it hard to understand how you could be so comfortable organising your private life and then seem to lose the better part of your self-confidence when you&rsquo;re in public. Maybe it&rsquo;s a question of rhythm? If you feel comfortable in your domestic rhythm it&rsquo;s perhaps because it works more on a short-term basis (day, week or more rarely a month). On the contrary, the rhythm of professional life seems less concrete and more distant as the professional agenda works more to quarterly or annual plans, that you have no control over. Is this the source of your lessened motivation? You can&rsquo;t control all the cards so you have to adapt and, in fact, that doesn&rsquo;t interest you at all? If this difference between work and home life doesn&rsquo;t bother you, then carry on. However, if you feel frustrated by this imbalance, it could be useful to look into the deeper reasons (either on your own or with someone else) that keep you less focused on professional ambition. For instance, such reasons could be: a lack of thanks and recognition, a fear of not being up to the mark&hellip; It&rsquo;s up to you to find out.</p>
<p><strong>Learning style test</strong></p>
<p>Your Scores:</p>
<p>Auditory: 30%</p>
<p>Visual: 20%</p>
<p>Tactile: 50%</p>
<p>You are a Tactile learner! Check out the information below, or view all of the learning styles.</p>
<p>Tactile</p>
<p>If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still.</p>
<p>As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when you become bored. You may be very well coordinated and have good athletic ability. You can easily remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw or heard in the process. You often communicate by touching, and you appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.</p>
<p><em>Here are some things that tactile learners like you can do to learn better:</em></p>
<p>Participate in activities that involve touching, building, moving, or drawing.</p>
<p>Do lots of hands-on activities like completing art projects, taking walks, or acting out stories.</p>
<p>It's OK to chew gum, walk around, or rock in a chair while reading or studying.</p>
<p>Use flashcards and arrange them in groups to show relationships between ideas.</p>
<p>Trace words with your finger to learn spelling (finger spelling).</p>
<p>Take frequent breaks during reading or studying periods (frequent, but not long).</p>
<p>It's OK to tap a pencil, shake your foot, or hold on to something while learning.</p>
<p>Use a computer to reinforce learning through the sense of touch.</p>
<p>Remember that you learn best by doing, not just by reading, seeing, or hearing.</p>
<p>My opinion</p>
<p>These tests embody my personality. They nearly reflect my own nature as well as allow me to see what potential I could have. After the tests, It give me compliments and I acknowledged that I should just keep calm and be myself as I inherently love what is really unique. On the other hand, I think these results will affect my behaviour when it comes to collaboration. Fortunately, the results are inclined to be positive meaning that I will be a decent element in a group and I will be more valuable. When forming a team I will introduce the positive aspects that the results have given out. After the introduction, I pleaded with my teammates to help me to get improvement from the drawbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Project Ideas</strong></p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>I am pursuing the goal of developing a game called &ldquo; Fireworks and Asteroids&rdquo;. This is a game project that I will use Unity to build. Back in the days when I just prototyped the ideas, the original ideas featured aliens as enemies but ideas changes over time. There are many sub-projects in this in the making of this game which are musics, arts creation thus I need participations who are willing to be involved. Furthermore, I have planned a scheldule to work on many parts in game making. I want to collaborate in my team and we want to earn some achievements. There is one thing that I truly want my game to have is something unique and innovative.</p>
<p>Motivation</p>
<p>Take a deeper look inside my game, there will be a wide range of elements attributed to the flow of the game itself. For example, the story is the essential part that will be discovered at the end of the game to end the game in a particular way and particular feeling. With this element in hand, I can come across something truly unique and once again I observe that typical images of games these days are those which use traditional mechanics without really trying something new. On the other hand, the quality of interactive story at the end of the game have to be reasonable. This analysis shows how much interest that audiences feel in each genre of movies .</p>
<p><a href="http://www.city-data.com/blog/5597-action-drama-favorite-movie-genres/">http://www.city-data.com/blog/5597-action-drama-favorite-movie-genres/</a></p>
<p>According to the bar chart, I will work on atrributing humorous moment to the game. Dramatic scenes are involved to tell player that something big will happen. It must be admitted, however, that the game should be enough interesting because how the data is given out.</p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-0/p280x280/118111882_310426296956299_6757002370329842680_n.png?_nc_cat=110&amp;_nc_sid=b96e70&amp;_nc_ohc=YwYhdGgSgOYAX9CL-mc&amp;_nc_ad=z-m&amp;_nc_cid=0&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.xx&amp;oh=173317e3ceb5c819dae230318a03594d&amp;oe=5F6CC333" alt="" width="335" height="280" /></p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good enough that we have a fun game to play. The game &ldquo;Fireworks and Asteroids&rdquo; is still in development and promises to bring a whole new experience to players. But on top of that, our choice of game has generally been substandard and expensive.And where other successful games have reasonable standards, such as: Plants vs Zombies, Bloons Tower Defense, Peggle, Chicken Invader,ect. The best of all are still Plants vs Zombies, Bloons Tower Defense. After all those days analysing those games as a part of game design practicing. We will also analyse &ldquo;Fireworks and Asteroids&rdquo; features to figure out if it is worth playing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This game has a strong following, among younger audiences, with over 60% of its users coming in under the age of 24.And its feature set depends on what the actual game cost implies. When looking at its design, three things immediately jumped out. The practical value of visual style, ...the importance of getting the navigation right early, and mostly for a game: How creative characters design truly matter.</p>
<p>This game would be my brainchild. A story telling technique blends with the music on its own produces many levels of emotions. I would like to mention that I create the music and stories because this is what I will actually put my heart in these. This time players will experience Mandela effect and D&eacute;j&agrave; vu effect without knowing that they had experienced those. Certain levels require familiar skills or a specific moment brings some acknowledgements for players. This game genre is known as Tower Defense and literally inspired by monster hit Plants vs Zombies but to make it even more interesting the game itself cleverly use some ideas from Plants vs Zombies and camouflage them and players will get D&eacute;j&agrave; vu moments. Players have to set fireworks on the round to shoot the asteroids, receive items to unlock and further their progress. To prevent them from quitting, the game also offers many types of sub-genre within the games. Here is what is so special, after you quit for a really long time, the game will grant players a gift, the game allows the player to play again and at the second time, he will discover a mystery.</p>
<p>Colors combination, fonts used, pressed buttons are decent and easy to use. Graphics use cheerful tone colors, the main font used is Helvetica where the lowercase &lsquo;f&rsquo; and &lsquo;t&rsquo; line up. These kinds of streamlined consistencies add upand help the reader to process sentences without getting a headache. If you are not convinced then try the Papyrus font paragraph. But anyway, button sets work in a similar way. I did pay attention to the small details because it helps people navigate. Visual is angelic enough for the brain to interpret what to explore in the game. The model is so simple. If you want to read in-game stories , they&rsquo;re in the &ldquo;more&rdquo; category. If you want to create your own enemy avatar, ...they&rsquo;ll be in the left. And if you want to view credit or quit, ...the options will be in the right and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>With that in mind, &ldquo;Fireworks and Asteroids&rdquo; will be the best and suitable choice for children and adults. I hope that this game will receive as many as poosible feedback to motivate me to moving on polishing the game.</p>
<p>Tools and Technologies</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity, Game maker: Crucial tool that help creating a game, softwares which I will mainly work on espescially coding, editing resources. On the other hand, Unity community is where I can connect which other game designer and do other brilliant work.</li>
<li>Adobe Photoshop: Unfortunately, all adobe softwares aren&rsquo;t free and I couldn&rsquo;t find any best alternative for these. However I manage to have a full version of Photoshop with a focus on creating pixel art, sprite and of course backgrounds.</li>
<li>Musescore 3, Audacity, Fl studio pro: Being a musician myself, I use all three softwares but the common one is musescore 3. All three can do a flavor, create smooth soundtracks in the game without distracting players&rsquo;s behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Skills Required</p>
<ul>
<li>Working with dramatic elements: Puzzle games are abstract. Take an example of chess, there is no story, no dramatic reason why you capture opponent&rsquo;s pieces. The game of mine is attributed some dramatic stories that will make a hook in the game&rsquo;s structure. I only need to listen to musics and feels, I can come up with a story &ndash; something I call improvising-.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Conceptualization: To come up with something unique is really daunting and challenging. This also requires brainstorming skills, editing and refining.</li>
<li>Prototyping: This lies at the heart of good game design. The process suggest you to build up from something original. I can go to supermaket to get inspired by a product then I draw it on paper and decide it act as a character for my game.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not hard to find these skills, these are researched in a book. I also need to print out material that I need but I can just go out and print so no need any hardware here.</p>
<p>Outcome</p>
<p>From my point of view, when this project really becomes my brainchild, it will mark my new milestone of achievement. I will get involved and trusted in the EA company, we will have a good time together. When this project is popular enough, I will celebrate my game birthday and keep dreaming about my life. On the other hand, this is what I make a living and to escape the boring life I had for so long. Because of this, I only wish there is no thing that can sabotage my path to success. This project will be default in EA company which means they will be decorated everywhere in their building as well as mark an important event in the game industry.</p>
